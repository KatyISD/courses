# Katy ISD CS Course Information

## Course Flowchart
Katy ISD has lots of computer science courses, and that means there's lots of confusion on where you can start and when you can take what. We've got a [PDF flowchart](./CS%20Courses%202022-2023%20-%20MS%20CTE%20Day.pdf) that should answer most of your questions. 

## AWS Cloud Computing
We're adding a new [AWS Cloud Computing class](AWS%20Academy%20Flyer%20(Print).pdf) for the 2023-2024 school year that will teach you what you need to know to take and pass an Amazon Web Services certification exam at the end of the year.
